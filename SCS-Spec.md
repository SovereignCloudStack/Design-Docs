# SCS specification draft 0.1

Must, Should, May, Should Not, Must Not used as in RFCs.

## Infrastructure (Software)

### BMC

Should support Redfish for server management (fallback: IPMI)

### Host OS: Linux

5\.4+

### Virtualization: KVM

5\.x+

### Storage (SDN): ceph

octopus+

### Networking (SDN): OvS/OVN

## Identity & Trust -- primary owner is GXFS

Must support federation of users

Must support SP role allowing Identities from Open ID Connect (OIDC) IdP

Must support flexible mapping of identity attributes to roles/rights

Should also support SP role with SAML Federation, also allowing mapping rules

Should support IdP role, allowing to expose locally managed identities to 3rd party SPs via OIDC

## IaaS layer

### OpenStack

Victoria or later

#### Version & upgrade policy

Follow SCS: SCS release \~5mo after OpenStack release, 1mo to upgrade to SCS-latest

#### RefStack, InterOp and Trademark Certification

Must comply (at least) to OpenStack Powered Compute 2020.11

Will move forward with newer SCS releases

#### Structure

##### Regions

domains must be cross-region

user management is per domain thus also cross-region

projects may be cross-region

TL;DR: regions must share identity management (keystone)\
Regions may share object storage namespace\
Regions should provide means to create network connections easily between them

##### Domains

Customers are handed out domains

Allowing sub structure (projects) managed by customer

User management (local users AND federated users) happens at domain level

##### Projects

Customer can create projects (limited by quota)

Customers should have more than one project quota by default

Project deletion: Cloud must revoke tokens. \
Cloud may require customer to have cleaned out all resources for project deletion to succeed.\
Cloud may do resource cleanup for customer when asked for deletion of project. Resource cleanup may be asynchronous then. Must not take longer than 24hrs.

Cloud must not leave orphaned resources around after project deletion (at least not longer than 24hrs). Specifically, it most also not bill them (at least no longer than 24hrs).

##### Availability zones

Compute availability zones. Must be fire protection zones, must have independent power supply. Must be reported by `openstack availability zone list --compute`.

Block storage (`openststack availability zone list --volumes`) must be EITHER one AZ for the whole region OR the same set as compute AZs. In the latter case, compute instances must have access at least to the volumes in the same AZ.

Network should not use availability zones. All networks in one region (for one project and connected by a router) should have connectivity. (TODO: Should we allow per-AZ networking? Then mandate same zoning&naming as compute. Or can we make this a must)

Non-OpenStack services may be added to the catalog, but then must have a provider prefix

TODO: Should we require that providers offer a per-project setting where only SCS-base, SCS-extended or full will be listed in service catalogue? Making it easier for dev teams to ensure they don't introduce a dependency by mistake?
